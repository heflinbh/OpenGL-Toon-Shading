This is the result of a class project I completed for my master's degree. Much of the base code was provided by my professor Dr. Shah of Northeastern Universty, with functional edits by me to open and read .OBJ files, render the object + outline, adjust the shaders, etc.

A fun opening to computer graphics :)
